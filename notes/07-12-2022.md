# Neural Rendering Updates (July 12, 2022)

## Train NeRF Revisited



<hr/>

## Light Moving With Fixed Camera
### Steps (+Calibration)
Calibaration step added from the [last week's](./07-05-2022.md) procedure.

1. Capture train and calibration board with phone camera
2. Run calibration, undistort images
3. Crop hologram area only
4. Run COLMAP <-- failed

<hr>

## Holotorch

<details>
<summary>Holotorch Tutorial</summary>

1. Example for ASM-propagator
2. Creating a Hologram using Double-Phase-Amplitude-Encoding (DPAC)
3. Near-Eye Hologram (ASM-propagation) optimization
4. Conventional Etendue Expansion with a random diffuser
5. Neural Etendue expansion (Deep Optics) with respect to an image dataset

Questions:
- Which simulation is relavant to us?
- How exactly NeRF + Holotorch works?
