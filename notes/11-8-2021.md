# Neural Rendering Updates (November 8, 2021)
## Downsample selected area of the image
- TL;DR => failed
- When downsampling, we use `cv2.resize(image, (w, h), interpolation=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)`
- When downsampling, the dimension of the image matrix will also get shrinked.
- Stitching shrinked black area to the non-downsampled inner-markers (the hologram panel) area is challenging due to the matrices' dimension mismatch.

## Obtaining fixed camera view
- Render(test) the circular view in [`sprial.py`](https://github.com/ActiveVisionLab/nerfmm/blob/main/tasks/any_folder/spiral.py#L180).
- Call the function called [`create_spiral_poses(radii, focus_depth, n_poses=120, n_circle=2)`](https://github.com/ActiveVisionLab/nerfmm/blob/dfa552bf4c2967d11dcd2ea8462fda2cbc96c4df/utils/pose_utils.py#L77) in above code, to get the camera trajectory in numpy array.
- Get the viewing z axis is the vector pointing from the `focus_depth` (the depth that the camera poses look at) plane to center by doing:
    ```
    z = normalize(center - np.array([0, 0, -focus_depth]))
    ```
- Adjust the offcet values (the array which gets subtracted) of the (0, 0) center into the left/right, and up/down located values.

    | Location     | Offset Code                       |
    | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
    | left-center  | `np.array([1, 0, -focus_depth])`  |
    | right-center | `np.array([-1, 0, -focus_depth])` |
    | down-center  | `np.array([0, 1, -focus_depth])`  |
    | up-center    | `np.array([0, -1, -focus_depth])` |

## Quantitative Analysis: PSNR & Differences
Steps ([`difference_comparison.ipynb`](../quantitative_measures/difference_comparison.ipynb)):
1. Downsample ground truth by 4 (ratio)
2. Find 6 markers from ground truth
3. Find 6 markers from the rendered (hardcoded coordinates)
4. Apply homography
5. Crop to have holography panel only
6. PSNR & Difference Calculation

### 1. PSNR Result
Reported: 30.25

Compared to PSNR results of other scenes:
| Method | Synthetic | Real Forward-Facing |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------- |
| LLFF   | 24.88     | 24.13               |
| NeRF   | 31.01     | 26.50               |

### 2. Grayscale difference calculation
