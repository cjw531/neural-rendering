# Holography Literature Review
1. Holographic Projection Technology: The World is Changing. [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.0846.pdf)
   - General holography usage and its future.

2. Rapid hologram generation utilizing layer-based approach and graphic rendering for realistic three-dimensional image reconstruction by angular tiling [[arxiv]](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Rapid-hologram-generation-utilizing-layer-based-approach-and-graphic-rendering/volume-23/issue-02/023016/Rapid-hologram-generation-utilizing-layer-based-approach-and-graphic-rendering/10.1117/1.JEI.23.2.023016.full?SSO=1)
   - Simplifies 3D object as layered cross-sectional images perpendicular to a chosen viewing direction.
   - Proposed rendering approach which incorporates clear depth cues, occlusion, and shading in the generated holograms for angular tiling.

3. 3D Holographic Rendering For Medical Images Using Manipulates Lighting in a 3D Pyramid Display [[arxiv]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sarah-Qahtan/publication/317901853_3D_Holographic_Rendering_For_Medical_Images_Using_Manipulates_Lighting_in_a_3D_Pyramid_Display/links/5951040445851543383c63e5/3D-Holographic-Rendering-For-Medical-Images-Using-Manipulates-Lighting-in-a-3D-Pyramid-Display.pdf)
   - Proposed new lighting system by adding six point
light sources (above, upper left, upper right, bottom, lower left, and lower right) to the 3D object. 
   - The light appeared equal and smooth in the four different view of the objects when the lighting hologram style was used.

4. Simple wave-field rendering for photorealistic reconstruction in polygon-based high-definition computer holography [[arxiv]](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-electronic-imaging/volume-21/issue-2/023002/Simple-wave-field-rendering-for-photorealistic-reconstruction-in-polygon-based/10.1117/1.JEI.21.2.023002.full)
    - High-definition holography is computed by creating a polygon mesh, and then applied smoothing to result a more realistic output.

5. Holographic representation: Hologram plane vs. object plane [[arxiv]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923596518300407#b48)
    - Direct visualization of the object plane amplitude in a regular 2D display without any transformation methods.
    - Possibility of holographic coding on the object plane.

6. Digital holography: Benchmarking coding standards and representation formats [[arxiv]](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.turing.library.northwestern.edu/document/7552940)
    - Holography reservation method
    - "i) the most appropriate reconstruction method depends on the content generation method and reconstruction distances; ii) the best standard coding solution is clearly HEVC Intra; and iii) the best representation formats are the Phase Shifted Distances and Real-Imaginary formats without significant difference in terms of compression performance"
