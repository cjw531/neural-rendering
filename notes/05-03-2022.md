# Neural Rendering Updates (May 3, 2022)

## NeRF TF2 Output
Summary: tried to adjust viewpoints, while somewhat failed.

| Normal View | Z-Adjusted | Y-Rotated (15 degree) |

- To have wider angle, the camera height (presumably z-axis) was adjusted (2nd `*.gif`).
- Render path is also getting learned (learning its ray based on position) during training, and this path is calculated based on the camera position/trajectory from the input images.
- If viewpoint from training is small, the rendered viewpoint is also small. This explains why the gantry-taken (zigzag) lion cubs had a wider array of rendered output.
- Adjusted view matrix to tilt the camera angle, but failed (3rd `.gif`). The coordinate system is camera-to-world, so performed rotation by 15 degree, along with its y-axis.

## Exposure Equalization
- Made a last minute hotfix --> now takes median for all (r,g,b), not separately.
- Link to [code](../quantitative_measures/polaroid_equalization.ipynb)

## Apply Super Pixel Algorithm?
- Tested [SRGAN](https://github.com/krasserm/super-resolution), but failed with their pre-trained network.
- They trained the network with DIV2K dataset, and it works very fast for predicting/making a new blurry image to a super pixel version, but not with our hologram images.
- [SRGAN Demo](https://github.com/krasserm/super-resolution/blob/master/example-srgan.ipynb) with ordinary image (NOT hologram) seems promisinng.
- Building a new network that takes hologram image and predicting along with rendering might be helpful. Training may happen concurrently along with NeRF network. 
- How rendering works is that they predict single image based on `render_poses` and merge them into a video later on, so we may enhance the image quality at this step.
